# 🌍 Carbon Emission Prediction

**Accurate forecasting of CO₂ emissions using machine learning for a sustainable future.**

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to predict carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions using historical environmental and industrial data with the help of machine learning models. It serves as a tool to support climate awareness, policy planning, and sustainability initiatives by identifying key factors contributing to emissions and projecting future trends.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Analyze historical CO₂ emission data from trusted sources.
* Train and evaluate ML models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, LSTM, etc.) for accurate prediction.
* Visualize emission trends and potential future scenarios.
* Support governments, industries, and individuals in making data-driven decisions for emission control.

## 🧠 Technologies Used

* **Languages:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Git, Streamlit (optional for dashboard)
* **Data Sources:** World Bank, Kaggle Datasets, IEA

## 📈 Key Features

* Data cleaning, exploration, and preprocessing
* Emission prediction using multiple ML algorithms
* Model evaluation with performance metrics (MAE, RMSE, R² Score)
* Optional dashboard for interactive visualization
